# Autonomous Delivery Bot 🚚

This repository contains the code, images, and documentation for the **Autonomous Delivery Bot** project built using Arduino. The bot is designed to autonomously navigate and deliver items to a specified location.

---

## Features ✨
- **Autonomous Navigation:** Uses sensors for obstacle detection and path planning.
- **Delivery System:** Integrated delivery mechanism for transporting items.
- **Arduino-Based:** Powered by Arduino microcontroller for seamless control.

## Components Used 🧩
- **Microcontroller:** Arduino
- **Sensors:** Ultrasonic, IR, or any other sensors (specify if needed)
- **Motors:** DC motors with motor driver
- **Battery:** Li-ion/LiPo for power supply
- **Chassis:** Custom-designed/bought

## How It Works 🚀
1. **Obstacle Detection:** The bot uses sensors to detect obstacles in its path.
2. **Path Navigation:** It calculates a route to avoid obstacles and reach its destination.
3. **Delivery Mechanism:** Once the bot arrives at the location, it triggers the delivery system.
